# Puddle.js -- Make A Splash

Puddle is a extremely simple concept that allows everybody to contribute to a library. This isn't a certain category of functions, its all your findings.

## Contribution Guidelines
#### What should I contribute to Puddle.JS?
If you create something that seems like it deletes an automated task, add it! Make sure the function isn't already there. Maybe you could contribute more words to the readme.md because I am lazy! Whatever you want as long as it is reasonable and doesn't change the whole subject of this project.
#### Rules/Actual Guidelines
1. No innapropraite or NSFW function(s) (I personally dont know how you could do NSFW. No Swearing.)
2. Make sure if you are contributing a function, make sure its not already implemented into Puddle.
3. If you are correcting a former function, do it in a humanly manner.
4. Want more rules? Contribute to the README.md

## How To Contribute
1. Follow the guidelines above.
2. Create a new branch with your new function(s)
3. Pull Request away.
